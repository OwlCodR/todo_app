## :sparkles: Feature list
**I phase:**
- :bangbang: Up-to-date README.md
- Logging using `logger`
- Internationalization using `intl`
- Localized app name
- Limitation of long texts in the task's title
- Swipe on item Done/Delete using `flutter_slidable`
- Code formatting is present
- The code is divided into features and layers
- Added and works `flutter_lints`, there are no unreasonable rule ignores in the code
- Working with asynchronous code is implemented uniformly: there is no incoherent mess of `.then` and `async`/`await`, the approach is logical
- Implemented work with the backend, data is sent/received from the server using `Dio`
- :sparkles: Work with the network is separated into a separate layer (`Repository`/`Datasource`), the code is encapsulated. Missing logic in presentation layer
- Organized saving data to disk using `Hive`
- :sparkles: The work is selected in a separate layer (`Repository`/`Datasource`)
- `Riverpod` is used for state management
- DI using `Riverpod`
- Firebase Crashlytics is connected to the project using `firebase_core` & `firebase_crashlytics`

**II phase:**
> Cleanliness of the code and the overall structure of the project
- :bangbang: Up-to-date README.md
- Added and works `flutter_lints`, there are no unreasonable rule ignores in the code
- Code formatting is present
- The code is divided into layers (layer-first)
> Receiving and storing data
- Implemented handling of server and other errors where they can often shoot
- The application works properly without the Internet
- :sparkles: Offline-first: work without the Internet is fully possible, at the next start it will send what could not leave in the previous session due to errors / lack of network
> Navigation, UI, animations
- The text of long notes is cut to fit the layout
- Implemented support for landscape orientation
- Implemented support for large screens (tablets)
> Architecture
- Working with data is organized in a separate entity, a repository, encapsulating in one place the receipt and updating / adding of data to disk
- State-management is implemented using `Riverpod`
- DI using `Riverpod`
> Additionally
- Using `freezed` for data-models
